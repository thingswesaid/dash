        If you purchased an extended video and didn't receive the link to view it don't panic! 
        We don't send links for the extended videos, instead all you need to do is navigate to the 
        page of the video you purchased and click on the <strong>SWITCH TO EXTENDED</strong> button
        at the bottom of the video.

      <Panel

        headerClass="my-header-class"
      >
        After your purchase, the extended video should start playing automatically. In case that 
        didn't happen all you need to do is make sure that you are logged in with the same email
        address used at checkout, navigate to the page of the video you want to watch and click on
        the <strong>SWITCH TO EXTENDED</strong> button at the bottom of the video.

        Yes! All you need to do is sign up with the same email address used at checkout and in 
        automatic you will have access to all the videos you purchased with that email address.

        When receiving a promo code you should be able to view it immediately on the video page, also
        you will receive an email with the promo code and instructions on how to use it. Finally, if 
        you're logged in, you are able to see all of your promo codes on the <a href='/user'>User Page</a>.

        Good news! Our payment system is powered by PayPal, but you are not required to be a member in order to 
        use it. PayPal infact, allows you to checkout as a guest while still processing your information in 
        complete safety.
